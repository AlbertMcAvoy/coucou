# Coucou for Windows

**Mochi doesn't get a notch on a PC — so it lives at the top of your screen instead.**

Approve Claude Code permissions, watch your session work, drop a file, chat with Claude, keep an eye on your services — without leaving what you're doing.

## Install

The downloadable installer is **temporarily unavailable**. Microsoft Defender
wrongly flags the unsigned installer as malware (`Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.H!ml`, a
machine-learning false positive). A report is under review at Microsoft, and the
installer will be published again once it is cleared and code-signed.

Until then, [build it yourself](#build-it-yourself): it takes a few minutes and
installs for the current user only — no admin prompt.

## Using it

<img src="screenshots/overview.png" width="640" alt="The overview: the focused integration on the left, the other pills on the right">

<img src="screenshots/drop.png" width="640" alt="Mochi turned into a box, waiting for a file">

| What you do | What happens |
|---|---|
| Move the mouse to the very top-centre of the screen | Mochi peeks out |
| Click the small island | It opens |
| Click Mochi | It gets annoyed. Three times in a row and it goes dizzy |
| Rest the pointer on Mochi for two seconds | Hearts |
| Drag a file onto the island | Mochi turns into a box, swallows it, then offers to answer questions about it |
| `Esc` | Closes the island |
| Tray icon | Open, Weekly recap, Settings…, Pause, Quit |

Everything else happens on its own: a Claude Code permission request opens the
island with **Deny / Allow**, a finished session shows what it did, and
your integrations sit in the coloured pills next to Mochi.

## Claude Code

<img src="screenshots/settings.png" width="562" alt="The settings window">

Open **Settings… → Claude Code → Install hooks…**. You get the exact diff of what
will change in `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json`, the path of the dated backup
that will be taken, and nothing is written until you click. Your own hooks are
never touched, and uninstalling removes only Coucou's entries.

The relay is a tiny executable, `coucou-hook.exe`, copied to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Coucou\bin\` at launch. It is given 300 ms to reach Coucou and
exits cleanly if the app is closed, slow or crashed — **a Claude Code session is
never blocked or slowed down by Coucou.** If nobody answers a permission request
in time, Coucou stays quiet and Claude Code asks in the terminal as usual.

It works from any terminal — Windows Terminal, PowerShell, VS Code, Git Bash.

## Weekly recap

On Monday from 8 am, the first time Coucou starts, an agent starts working or
you wake the island, a card sums up the past week: time spent, sessions, files
and lines changed, commands run, permissions and questions, your top agent,
top project, busiest day and longest session. **Tray → Weekly recap** opens it
any day.

**Share image** turns it into a 1080 × 1920 picture with Mochi. **Save image**
writes it to your Pictures folder (Downloads if there is none) as
`Coucou weekly recap YYYY-MM-DD.png`, never over an existing file; **Copy** puts
it on the clipboard. **Hide project names** leaves the project out of the image.

The history is `recap.json` next to the log, a 12-week rolling window: counts,
the agent and the project folder's name — never a command, a file path, file
contents or a prompt. It never leaves your machine. **Settings → General →
Weekly recap** turns it off or clears it.

## Chat and keys

**Settings… → Claude** takes your Anthropic API key. Keys live in the **Windows
Credential Manager**, never on disk and never in the interface — the island can
only ask whether a key exists. Same for every integration key.

No telemetry. The only network requests Coucou makes are to the services you
configure yourself.

## Build it yourself

You need [Rust](https://rustup.rs), [Node 20+](https://nodejs.org), and the
**MSVC build tools** (Visual Studio Build Tools with "Desktop development with
C++"). WebView2 ships with Windows 10/11.

```powershell
cd windows
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # live-reloading development build
npm run pack           # builds the installer and drops it in windows/release/
```

`npm run dev` alone serves the front end in an ordinary browser, which is enough
to work on the island's looks. It also serves `dev/upload-preview.html`, which
replays the whole file-drop choreography on a loop — the one part of the UI that
otherwise needs a real drag from Explorer to see — and `dev/recap-preview.html`,
the weekly recap card and its shared image on a sample week. None of these pages
ships in the app.

`npm run pack` leaves two files in `windows/release/`, the same names the release
workflow publishes:

```
Coucou-Windows-X.Y.Z-setup.exe    the versioned installer
Coucou-Windows-setup.exe          the same file under the rolling name
```

Installing is optional — `target/release/coucou.exe` runs on its own. There is no
window in the taskbar and no console: the island at the top of the screen and the
Mochi in the notification area are the whole app, and Quit lives in its menu.

The 28 sounds are the macOS app's own files; they are never duplicated in this
folder. The path is declared once, in `SOUNDS_DIR` at the top of
`vite.config.ts` — when they move to `shared/sounds/`, change that one line.

The app icon and the tray icon are drawn in code, like Mochi itself:

```powershell
npm run icons          # regenerates src-tauri/icons from scripts/gen-icons.mjs
```

### Layout

```
windows/
  src/                 island front end (TypeScript, no framework)
    mochi/             Mochi and the launch greeting, in Canvas 2D
    island/            state machine, hooks, integrations
    views/             every island view
    settings/          the settings window
  src-tauri/           Rust backend: window, named pipe, Claude API, pollers
  hook/                coucou-hook.exe, the Claude Code relay
  scripts/             icon generator
```

### Log

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Coucou\coucou.log` — hook events, permission decisions, poller
problems. It stays on your machine. The weekly recap's history sits beside it in
`recap.json`.

## Supported agents

The relay (`coucou-hook.exe`) works with any tool that can run a command on hook events. Pass `--agent <name>` to create a named pill.

| Agent | How to connect | Config file |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | **Settings → Claude Code → Install hooks** | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json` |
| Gemini CLI | `--agent gemini` positional arg | `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\settings.json` |
| Antigravity | `--agent antigravity` positional arg | `%USERPROFILE%\.config\antigravity\hooks.json` |
| Cursor | hooks installed automatically | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json` |
| Codex | `--agent codex` positional arg | `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\hooks.json` |
| Copilot CLI | `--agent copilot` positional arg + camelCase events | `%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\hooks\coucou.json` |
| Muse Code | `--agent muse` positional arg | `%USERPROFILE%\.config\muse\settings.json` |
| Any other | `--agent <name>` positional arg | your tool's hook config |

OpenCode, Amp and Hermes are not yet supported on Windows or Linux. Their integration uses a plugin that calls `/bin/sh` with macOS-specific paths; the plugin installer lives in the Mac app only.

## What's different from the Mac version

- No notch, so the island lives at the top centre of the screen and retracts into
  the top edge instead of hiding in a notch.
- Permission approval works from **any** terminal; the Mac build only listens to
  VS Code sessions.
- Not in this version: sending a file by email, dragging Mochi onto a window to
  attach it as context, and jumping to a specific terminal window — "Open
  terminal" opens the working folder in VS Code when `code` is on your `PATH`.
- Cal.com shows the next bookings as a list rather than the Mac's calendar.
- Weekly recap:
  - Sharing happens inside the island instead of a separate panel, and Save
    writes straight into Pictures (or Downloads) instead of asking where. There
    is no system Share sheet; Copy uses the web clipboard.
  - Questions are counted when an agent asks one (`AskUserQuestion`), not when
    it is answered from the island, which can't answer questions yet.
  - There is no sleep/wake notification to listen to without a background
    loop, so after the machine wakes the Monday card waits for the first agent
    to start or for you to hover the island.
  - The card is 24 px taller than the Mac's: it also lists top agent, project,
    busiest day, longest session, permissions and questions, which the Mac
    leaves to the image. A turn cut short by the session ending still counts.
  - Tray → Pause doesn't stop the history (it stays on the machine anyway);
    switch it off in Settings → General.

## Linux

The same app builds for Linux: everything that differs lives in
`src-tauri/src/platform/`, and the relay's transport in `hook/src/unix.rs`.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-layer-shell-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
  librsvg2-dev libssl-dev libdbus-1-dev patchelf \
  gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # live-reloading development build
npm run pack           # AppImage, .deb and .rpm in windows/release/
```

What changes on Linux:

- **The island** is a gtk-layer-shell overlay anchored to the top edge, over any
  top panel, on compositors that support it: COSMIC, KDE Plasma, Hyprland, Sway
  and other wlroots compositors. GNOME has no layer-shell, so there the island
  is a regular window. `COUCOU_LAYER_SHELL=0` forces that mode anywhere.
- **Click-through** is the window's input region, kept equal to the island
  shape, so the compositor sends every other click to what is underneath.
- **Mochi's eyes** follow the pointer only while it is over the island: Wayland
  gives no app the cursor position anywhere else.
- **Claude Code hooks** go through `~/.local/share/coucou/bin/coucou-hook` and a
  Unix socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/coucou.sock`. Both ends check that the other
  runs as the same user.
- **Keys** live in the Secret Service (GNOME Keyring, KWallet).
- **Files**: preferences in `~/.config/coucou/`, the log at
  `~/.local/share/coucou/coucou.log`, the weekly recap history beside it in
  `recap.json`. A saved recap image goes to the pictures folder named in
  `~/.config/user-dirs.dirs`, else `~/Pictures`, else `~/Downloads`.
- **Copying the recap image** needs a WebKitGTK with image clipboard support;
  where it is missing, the island says so and Save still works.
- What the Windows build leaves out, this one does too: sending a file by
  email, dragging Mochi onto a window, and jumping to a specific terminal
  window — "Open terminal" opens the folder in VS Code.
